# Computer Vision Course Assignments

This repository includes a series of hands-on assignments aimed at enhancing your skills in computer vision. The exercises span various key topics, from basic image processing operations to more advanced methods like feature detection and frequency domain analysis. Each assignment is provided as a Jupyter Notebook, which presents a specific problem followed by the implementation of a solution.

## Folder Structure

- **HW1**: Image Fundamentals  
  Involves working with basic image operations, such as quantization, interpolation, and point processing. The goal is to practice techniques like adjusting the image's bit depth and modifying brightness or contrast.  
  - Contains: `HW1.ipynb`, images in `BMP` or `JPG` format.

- **HW2**: Contrast Adjustment and Filtering  
  Focuses on methods for adjusting image contrast, including histogram equalization. You'll also explore filtering techniques and work with noise, such as salt-and-pepper and Gaussian noise, and learn how to handle them.  
  - Contains: `HW2.ipynb`, images in `BMP` or `JPG` format.

- **HW3**: Frequency and Wavelet Domain Processing  
  This homework delves into transformations like the Fourier transform and wavelet decompositions. You'll learn how to apply frequency domain filtering and conduct multi-level wavelet analysis on images.  
  - Contains: `HW3.ipynb`, images in `BMP` or `JPG` format.

- **HW4**: Color Space Conversion and Feature Detection  
  You will explore the conversion between different color spaces, such as RGB to HSV, and learn how to apply feature detection techniques like Harris Corner and SIFT/SURF, including tasks like image stitching.  
  - Contains: `HW4.ipynb`, images in `BMP` or `JPG` format.
